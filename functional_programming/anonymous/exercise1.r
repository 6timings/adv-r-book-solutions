### Given a function, like "mean", match.fun() lets you find a function. Given a function, can you find its name?

# No.

### Why doesnâ€™t that make sense in R?

# Because functions are anonymous in R, they are not bound to any particular name.  Any function could be given any name.


## IGOR
#1. Anonymous Functions Don't have `names` by definition and therefore this isn't possible.
