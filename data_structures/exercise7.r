# How would you describe the following three objects? What makes them different to 1:5?
# x1 <- array(1:5, c(1, 1, 5))
# x2 <- array(1:5, c(1, 5, 1))
# x3 <- array(1:5, c(5, 1, 1))

# They are array with different dimensions: one is a 1 x 1 x 5 matrix,
# the second a 1 x 5 x 1 matrix, and the last a 5 x 1 x 1 matrix.
# This will make the interact differently with array operations.

# TODO: (RK) Example of above claim?
